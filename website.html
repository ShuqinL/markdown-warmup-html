        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Combining both modern and traditional architecture, Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history dating back three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries, and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium A.D. Encyclopædia Britannica notes that "few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural center of an area as immense as China."<br> With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. <br><em>The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates. It has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal – all popular locations for tourism.</em> <em>Siheyuans</em>, the city's traditional housing style, and <em>hutongs</em>, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.</p>

        <h4>Architecture</h4>
        <p><em>Three styles of architecture</em> are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is <strong>the traditional architecture of imperial China</strong>, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. <br>Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as <strong>the "Sino-Sov" style</strong>, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.<br>Finally, there are much more <strong>modern architectural forms</strong>, most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters, in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
        <h4>Cusine</h4>
        <p>Beijing cuisine, also known as Jing cuisine and Mandarin cuisine, and as Beiping cuisine in Taiwan, is the local cuisine of Beijing, the national capital of China.</p>
